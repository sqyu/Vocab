This is the program I wrote many years ago to help myself memorize GRE vocabulary, and it indeed helped me to get a 163 on the verbal section.

The menu supports English, Chinese (simplified and traditional) and Japanese. Korean and French will be available in the future.

The program is fully functioning and has many functions one would or would not expect, but the code might need to be cleaned up a bit since it was written before I took my algorithm class... (I know Vocab.py should be split into multiple files but I did not have time to make that change)

I made modifications to it earlier in 2017 for compatibility with Japanese Kanken (Kanji Test) Level 2 words and Korean vocabulary (including a function that automatically scrapes the phonetic Hangul from wiktionary, as the Korean orthography and pronunciataions are already inconsistent due to liaison)...

But all those changes were lost due to a recent computer breakdown.


Ass.py helps make word lists.

Record keeps track of time and book, lists and words studied during each session.

System Files is just what its name suggests.

Vocab.py is the main file.

Word lists currently has word lists from four books: Petit Livre Rouge and Trois Mille are two popular GRE vocab books in Chinese, and Le Fran√ßais is a book on French in Chinese. I used to have Kanken Level 2 and Korean word lists but now they are gone...


More details to be added in the future...
